## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I created this page to showcase my career as a software developer.
- As I learn new skill I will add that to the growing list of skills I have on this page.
- I can also use this page as a place to try new things and get ideas onto the page.
- I was really able to understand FlexBox better. I learned many new tips and tricks for CSS and styling text, images, and backgrounds.

## Installation

Nothing to Intall. 

## Usage

There is a navigation bar at the top of the page if you would like to quickly access other portions of the webpage.

Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
